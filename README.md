## A Risk Assessment For ServiceNow with Risk Mitigation Suggestions and Cost Benefit Analysis: 
This project provides a structured risk assessment and mitigation plan for ServiceNow, an enterprise IT service management platform widely adopted in academic and business environments. The analysis is framed to identify, evaluate, and propose countermeasures for key risks associated with the platform, with an emphasis on both cybersecurity threats and operational vulnerabilities. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is included to support strategic decision-making around proposed mitigation strategies.

# Key Deliverables
- Risk Analysis and Assessment:
A detailed examination of potential risks in the ServiceNow ecosystem, including data breaches, unauthorized access, misconfigurations, downtime, and integration failures. Each risk is rated by likelihood and impact, forming a risk matrix for prioritization.

- Risk Mitigation Recommendations:
Actionable suggestions tailored to high and medium-priority risks, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), access control policies, role-based permissions, encryption in transit/storage, configuration audits, and third-party security assessments.

- Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA):
Evaluation of the financial and operational trade-offs of each mitigation strategy. The CBA compares the cost of implementing controls vs. the potential cost of a breach or failure, reinforcing the business value of proactive security investments.
